powerup_palettes:
  # Power-ups typically use sprite palettes, map to specific palette indices
  health: 2      # Use EnemyFire palette (red)
  weapon: 4      # Use EnemyFlying palette (yellow/gold)
  shield: 3      # Use EnemyIce palette (blue)
  special: 6     # Use MiniBoss palette (magenta)

palette_mapping:
  # Default mappings - game uses palette attributes to assign these
  # BG palette 0 is typically used for most tiles
  # Sprites cycle through OBJ palettes based on type
  notes: |
    To change which palette is used for specific elements:
    1. Edit the colors in the palette definition above
    2. Palettes are loaded in order: BG 0-7, then OBJ 0-7
    3. Game code determines which palette index each sprite/tile uses
    4. Fine-tuning requires ROM analysis to find palette attribute writes
